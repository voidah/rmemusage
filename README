rmemusage tries to show the real memory usage used by processes/users on linux. It uses libproc to query process information and estimate _real_ per-process memory usage.

To build:
g++ main.cc -l proc-3.2.8 -o rmemusage

To run (as root to have information about all processes):
# ./rmemusage [-u]

When ran without options, it simply output all processes currently running and their memory usage. When ran with the -u option, it calculate memory usage per-user.
